# ðŸš€ Lifecycle Mastery: Managing Power Platform Assets in the Age of Agents

As AI agents take center stage in Power Platform innovation, the need for robust, scalable, and secure application lifecycle management (ALM) has never been more critical. This hands-on workshop dives deep into how Managed Environments can help you master the lifecycle of apps, flows, and agentsâ€”ensuring governance and agility go hand in hand.

You'll learn how to implement modern ALM strategies using built-in features like solution-aware pipelines, environment routing, maker onboarding policies, and data loss prevention (DLP) enforcementâ€”all designed to support a safe and streamlined deployment experience across the development lifecycle.

## ðŸŽ¯ What you'll learn

- Explore how Managed Environments enhance ALM with policy-driven controls and telemetry
- Set up and use Power Platform Pipelines for secure, automated deployments
- Apply environment routing to guide apps and agents to the right zones
- Learn how ALM patterns extend to Copilot Studio agents and future AI workloads
- Get hands-on with solution packaging, approvals, and rollback strategies

Whether you're a Center of Excellence leader, IT admin, or solution architect, you'll leave with the tools and templates to implement lifecycle best practices that are agent-ready and enterprise-proven.
