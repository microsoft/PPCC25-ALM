# üöÄ Lab 3: Deploy

A key facet of healthy ALM is separating changes in development from those in testing and in production. Pipelines in Power Platform deploys the latest version of your solution across these environments, with the ability to add secure approvals and review changes before they‚Äôre deployed. Note: in this lab you‚Äôll only deploy from development to production, but in the real world it‚Äôs recommended to add an additional test stage. Other stages may also be added.


## üéØ Prerequisites:

- Complete lab 2.1
- If you did not complete lab 2.1, import the ContosoRealEstate_1_0_0_1.zip unmanaged solution in your development environment. This solution is available in your lab materials folder.

## üéØ Lab 3 Tasks

- Types of Pipelines
- Task 1 - Create a Platform Host pipeline
  - Deploy using Platform Host pipeline
- Task 2 - Create a Custom Host pipeline
  - Create a Custom Host environment
  - Configure environment records for the pipeline
  - Configure a basic pipeline
  - Deploy using a Custom Host pipeline
- Task 3 (Optional) - Extend pipelines (optional, but highly recommended)
  - Gated extensions
  - Create an Application User
  - Create Sharing Security Group
  - Create application user in Dataverse
  - Create an approval + SPN delegated deployment flow
  - Update flow after solution import
  - Update pipeline to run as delegated
  - Create a security role
  - Share MDA with security role
  - Run SPN delegated pipeline
- Task 4 - Redeploy a prior version

## Types of Pipelines

There are two ways to configure Power Pipelines:

**Platform host** - Out of the box tenant-wide pipelines ghosted under a "platform host" configuration. These pipelines are configured by makers for personal use. Personal pipelines cannot be extended, nor can they be shared with other makers in the tenant.

**Custom host** - Pipelines configuration hosted under a custom environment, where Power Pipelines modules are installed by admins. Custom pipelines enable greater control as they are centrally governed by admins and shared with makers for use. Custom host pipelines also provide greater visibility, like audit where a certain solution is deployed and who initiated the request. Custom host pipelines also retain backups of solution artifacts in both Managed and Unmanaged forms. Due to these reasons, custom hosts draw from your Dataverse storage capacity whereas the platform host doesn't.


## üéØ Task 1 - Create a Platform Host Personal Pipeline

- Navigate to your Dev environment. On the Maker Portal (https://make.preview.powerapps.com), make sure the Dev env is selected on the top right environment drop down
- Click on Solutions tab in the left-hand navigation blade
- Once in the Solutions page, open the Contoso Real Estate solution
- On the left-hand navigation panel, click on the rocket icon for Power Pipelines page
- On the Pipelines page, select + Create pipeline
- In the Create pipeline pop out wizard, provide the following details:
  - Name: <Your Name> Platform Host Pipeline
  - Description: Include description of which environments this pipeline will deploy to
  - Target environment: select your UAT environment
  - Click Save

![Screenshot 1](assets/image1.png)

- The completed pipeline should now have two stages‚ÄîDevelopment and UAT.

![Screenshot 2](assets/image2.png)

You‚Äôre now ready to use this Pipeline to deploy your solutions! In the real world, if your specific deployment process requires an additional environment, click on Add Stage button to add additional stages.


### üîß Deploy using a Platform Host pipeline

Now, let‚Äôs do a quick deployment to the UAT env to test our pipeline.

- On the UAT stage, click Deploy here to initiate the solution deployment to production.
- You can schedule deployments by selecting Later in the Deployment Schedule section to set a time and date for your scheduled deployment.
- Click Next
- In the summary section, review the AI-generated note in the Deployment Notes section. It contains a summary of your solution‚Äôs capabilities.
- Click Deploy to begin your deployment

![Screenshot 3](assets/image3.png)

Your UAT stage will update with the progress of the deployment:


![Screenshot 4](assets/image4.png)

When the deployment completes, you can see the success message on the stage:


![Screenshot 5](assets/image5.png)

Remember: Platform Host pipelines are not shareable, nor can they be extended to support approvals or delegations. Continue to the Custom Host Pipelines section to create extendable and shareable pipelines.


## üéØ Task 2 - Create a Custom Host Pipeline


### üîß Create a Custom Host environment

Let‚Äôs begin by creating a new Custom Host Environment. This special-purpose environment acts as the¬†storage¬†and management plane for all pipeline configuration, security, and run history. You can install multiple Custom Host environments to separately manage pipelines for different business orgs or geographic locations. One host for the entire tenant is also acceptable as long as all environments are in the same geographic location.

- In the Power Platform Admin Center (https://admin.preview.powerplatform.microsoft.com/) select Deployments from the left-hand navigation panel
- Make sure you are on the Overview tab
- Click + New custom host button to kick off a new environment creation with Power Platform Pipelines modules pre-installed.

![Screenshot 6](assets/image6.png)

- Configure the New Environment creation:
  - Name: ‚ÄúCustom Host Environment‚Äù
  - Make this a Managed Environment: Yes
  - Region: Canada
  - Get new features early: Yes
  - Type: Developer
  - Click Next
  - (Optional) Under Security Group, click + Select, select None
Note: In a real-world setting, using a Security Group is recommended to allow only authorized users access to this environment.

  - Click Save

![Screenshot 7](assets/image7.png)


![Screenshot 8](assets/image8.png)

Now that the Custom Host Environment is created, we can begin configuring the custom host pipeline.

We will be using the same Dev and UAT environments for the Custom Host pipeline we build in this lab. Make sure you have the EnvironmentIds for both environments handy.

Original Environment Name

New Environment Name

EnvironmentId

Purpose

Power App User 1

Dev

Development

Power App User 2

Hotfix

Secondary environment for hotfix development and multi-environment testing

Power App User 3

UAT

Testing your solution

Power App User 4

Production

Where your solutions are shared with end users


### üîß Configure environment records for the pipeline

- Navigate back to PowerApps maker portal at https://make.preview.powerapps.com/
- In the top right hand corner in the Environment selection dropdown, select the Custom Host Environment which you just created
- Click on the Apps tab
- Click on the play icon on the Deployment Pipeline Configuration app to play it

![Screenshot 9](assets/image9.png)

- In the Pipeline Configuration app, select Environments on the left pane, then + New

![Screenshot 10](assets/image10.png)

- Let‚Äôs create the development (source) environment record. We will use the Dev environment for this. Select New in the ribbon to create a new environment record
  - Name: Dev Environment
  - Environment Type: Select Development Environment for your source environment
  - Environment Id: <Environment ID of the Dev env >
  - Click Save
  - Wait for one minute, and click refresh in the ribbon to check the Validation Status
Since we already used this Dev environment in our Platform Host Pipeline, the validation will fail.


![Screenshot 11](assets/image11.png)

  - Let‚Äôs use the Force Link button in the ribbon to bypass this error. Click Force Link in the ribbon, then click Confirm in the dialog box.

![Screenshot 12](assets/image12.png)

  - Wait a minute, then refresh to verify Validation Status equals Success

![Screenshot 13](assets/image13.png)

- Let‚Äôs create the UAT (target) environment record. Select New in the ribbon to create a new environment record
  - Name: UAT Environment
  - Environment Type: Target Environment
  - Environment Id: <Environment ID of the UAT env>
  - Click Save
  - If Validation fails, repeat the steps to Force Link this environment to the Custom Host Pipeline
  - Once complete, verify Validation Status equals Success

![Screenshot 14](assets/image14.png)

- Repeat step 7 again if you want to add more than one target environment

### üîß Configure a basic pipeline

- Select Pipelines in the left navigation pane

![Screenshot 15](assets/image15.png)

- Select New in the ribbon to create a new deployment pipeline record
  - Name: Custom Host Pipeline
  - Description: optional, add a description of the purpose this pipeline serves
  - AI deployment notes: Enabled
  - Allow redeployments of older versions: Enabled
  - Deployment Type: Standard
  - Click Save

![Screenshot 16](assets/image16.png)

- Scroll down to the Linked Development Environments grid
  - Click on the three vertical dots on the top right corner of the grid to open additional grid options
  - Select Add Existing Deployment Environment, then select Dev environment you configured earlier in this lab, then click Add

![Screenshot 17](assets/image17.png)

- In the Deployment Stages (Deployment pipeline) grid, select New Deployment Stage
- Complete the form:
  - Name: UAT Environment
  - Description: optional, add a description of the environment you are deploying to
  - Previous Deployment Stage: Leave blank as this will be our first deployment stage
  - Target Deployment Environment ID: UAT Environment
  - Click Save and Close

![Screenshot 18](assets/image18.png)

- In the real world, repeat last two steps if you have more than one target environments for your pipeline.
- This pattern can be repeated to add up to 7 deployment stages in your pipeline.
Congratulations! You have created a basic Custom Host Pipeline. Go to your development (source) environment, and open any unmanaged solution. Then, click on the Pipelines tab (rocket icon) to open the Pipelines pane. Here, you will see your newly created pipeline:


![Screenshot 19](assets/image19.png)


### üîß Deploy Using a Custom Host pipeline

- Click Deploy here button in the UAT Environment stage
- You will get a popup which asks you to enable Managed Environments (ME) on the target env. Remember, Pipelines are a ME only feature. Your Target environments must be enabled for ME to perform a deployment. Only Power Platform and D365 Admins will see this prompt, so in the real world, admins should enable ME on every environment they expect to be used in a pipeline. Steps to enable ME can be found here. Click Enable managed environment

![Screenshot 20](assets/image20.png)

- Follow the same steps you performed in the Deploy Using a Platform Host pipeline section to complete the deployment.
So far, the two types of pipelines we‚Äôve explored enable basic deployments only. However, some processes call for greater control over the deployment process to ensure production assets are kept safe from unintentional or unapproved changes. For example, while administrators have permission to deploy to production, it‚Äôs important makers and developers do not have elevated access. Or, maybe the process mandates an admin or change manager‚Äôs approval before a deployment to production can be initiated. Let‚Äôs configure our pipeline to support these processes.


## üéØ Task 3 (Optional) - Extend Pipelines


### üîß Gated extensions


![Screenshot 21](assets/image21.png)

In this section, we will extend deployment pipelines we created in the sections above. Extending pipelines allows organizations to tailor pipelines to their unique needs. For example, you can add approvals, deploy via service principals, and integrate with internal systems of record, Azure DevOps, GitHub, and much more. Custom steps can be initiated at various stages of the pipeline. These steps are defined by Microsoft Dataverse business events. In Power Pipelines terminology, these initiation stages are called ‚ÄúGated Extensions.‚Äù Here are the 3 available gated extensions:

Pre-export step required: Allows running custom validation logic when a deployment request is submitted. Pipelines won‚Äôt export the solution from a development environment until this step is marked as completed. This should only be used on the first stage of the pipeline.

Pre-deployment step required: Allows initiation of custom steps after a deployment has been triggered, but before installation begins on the target environment.  This gated extension can be used to trigger processes such as approvals before a solution is deployed to the target environment.

Is delegated deployment: Carries out deployments using a service principal or pipeline stage owner‚Äôs identity instead of the requesting maker‚Äôs identity. This identity ensures makers can request deployments without elevated (or any) access within target environments. Requires approval from an authorized identity.

Each step of a pipeline deployment triggers a real-time event at the beginning and completion of the step for which you can initiate custom logic. Additional triggers are produced when gated extensions are enabled. These correspond to the custom step inserted when an extension is enabled on the pipeline stage.

The tables here indicate triggers and actions required for each extension:

Gated extension

Start trigger

Complete Step

Unbound action

Connection to use

Pre-export step required

OnDeploymentRequested

N/A

UpdatePreExportStepStatus

Any identity with access to update the deployment stage run record

Is delegated deployment

OnApprovalStarted

OnDeploymentCompleted

Create a connection as the service principal or pipeline stage owner as configured on the pipeline stage. The pipeline stage owner must be an owner of the service principal in Microsoft Entra ID.

Predeployment step required

OnPreDeploymentStarted

OnPreDeploymentCompleted

UpdatePreDeploymentStepStatus

Any identity with access to update the deployment stage run record

Now, let‚Äôs extend the Custom Host pipeline we created in the previous task to include an Approval step. Once we get the approval, we will perform a Delegated deployment using a SPN user.


### üîß Create Application User

  - Navigate to https://portal.azure.com
You‚Äôll need to set up MFA to proceed with the Enterprise Application creation. This is a security requirement for accessing the Azure portal. Follow the on screen instructions to configure MFA.

  - Once you have access to the Azure portal, search ‚ÄúEnterprise Applications‚Äù in the top search bar

![Screenshot 22](assets/image22.png)

  - In the Enterprise applications page, click + New Application, then select + Create your own application

![Screenshot 23](assets/image23.png)

  - In the Create your own application wizard, provide a name for your enterprise application. We will use ‚ÄúDelegated Deployment User.‚Äù Click Create

![Screenshot 24](assets/image24.png)

  - Once your Enterprise application is created, in the left hand navigation pane, click Owners under the Manage tab
  - Click + Add to add your own user as an owner. You can find your own username by clicking your username on the top right corner. It will most likely begin with ‚ÄúODL_User‚Ä¶‚Äù Click Select

![Screenshot 25](assets/image25.png)

This owner you added to this application user must correspond to the Stage Owner where you initiate the gated extension from. We will need to remember this for later in this lab.


![Screenshot 26](assets/image26.png)

  - Under the Security tab, select Permissions, then click the Application registration link
Next, let‚Äôs add a certificate to our new app user. This is how we will authenticate our connection.

- Under the Manage tab, click on Certificated & secrets
Click + New client secret

Description: Delegated Deployment

Expires: Recommended: 180 days (6 months)

IMPORTANT: note the client secret value before navigating away and store it in an easily accessible place. Tip‚Äîuse Notepad, sticky notes, or OneNote for easy copy/paste later

Value:


![Screenshot 27](assets/image27.png)

Click on the Overview tab in the navigation blade

Note down Application (client) ID and Directory (tenant) ID

Application (client) ID:

Directory (tenant) ID:


![Screenshot 28](assets/image28.png)


### üîß Create Sharing Security Group

While we are still on the Azure portal, let‚Äôs create our security group.

- Navigate to the new group creation page by using this link: https://portal.azure.com/?l=en.en-ie#view/Microsoft_AAD_IAM/AddGroupBlade
- Use the following group details:
    - Group Type: Security
    - Group Name: Production App Access Group
- Click No members selected to add members to the group
    - Search for your own lab user, click Select

![Screenshot 29](assets/image29.png)

Your group should look like this before clicking Create:


![Screenshot 30](assets/image30.png)


### üîß Create application user in Dataverse

Add Application User to each environment of our pipeline, including the Custom Host Environment

- Navigate to PPAC at admin.powerplatform.microsoft.com
- In the Environments tab, select your Custom Host environment
- In the Access section, under S2S apps, click See all
- Click + New app user
- App: click + Add an app > select the app registration you created in step 1 (you may need to search the name of the App Registration if it is not listed) > click Add
- Business unit: select default BU (type ‚Äúorg‚Äù and select the first item)
- Security roles: System Administrator*
*The System Administrator role is required for the SPN user as it is necessary to deploy certain solutions containing components, such as plugins.


![Screenshot 31](assets/image31.png)

- Click Create
- Your application user will be listed with a # prefix in the Name column

![Screenshot 32](assets/image32.png)

- Repeat this process for your Dev and UAT environments

### üîß Create an approval + SPN delegated deployment flow

Pathway 1-- For the purposes of this lab, we have provided a complete version of this flow in your lab materials folder. If you are running low on time but would still like to complete this section of the lab, manually import the ‚ÄúLab 3 Approval Delegation Flow.zip‚Äù solution folder in your Custom Host Environment. After import, jump to Update Flow after solution import section.

Pathway 2 -- If you would like to create the flow manually, follow the steps below.

NOTE: In the instructions below, we have provided the written expression for the dynamic values. You may choose to copy/paste the expressions from the instructions below, or use the lightning bolt icon to add the dynamic values to your flow manually.

Navigate back to https://make.preview.powerapps.com/ and select your Custom Host Environment from the environment picker dropdown

Click Flows from the left-hand navigation blade

Click + New flow > choose "Automated cloud flow" and name your flow ‚ÄúSPN Delegated Deployment Approvals‚Äù

Select the trigger "When an action is performed" from the Dataverse connector.


![Screenshot 33](assets/image33.png)

Configure the trigger with the following parameters:

Catalog:¬†Microsoft Dataverse Common

Category:¬†Power Platform Pipelines

Table Name:¬†(none)

Action Name:¬†OnApprovalStarted


![Screenshot 34](assets/image34.png)

Click the three dots and select Settings, set the trigger condition to the below parameter. This trigger condition allows us to have a unique flow process for each pipeline. If you‚Äôd like to use the same flow for all your pipelines, skip this step: @equals(triggerOutputs()?['body/OutputParameters/DeploymentPipelineName'], 'Custom Host Pipeline')


![Screenshot 35](assets/image35.png)

- On the trigger ‚ÄúWhen an action is performed‚Äù Dataverse action, click the 3 dots, click + Add new connection [Connection Reference]
- Configure the connection:
  - Authentication Type: Service Principal
  - Client ID: <Client ID of the App User you created earlier>
  - Client Secret: <Client secret of the App User certificate you created earlier>
  - Tenant: <TenantID you saved earlier>

![Screenshot 36](assets/image36.png)

Click +New Step and search for "Start and wait for an approval" in the Standard Approvals connector.


![Screenshot 37](assets/image37.png)

Configure the approval with the following parameters (you may copy/paste the parameters):

Approval Type:¬†Approve/Reject ‚Äì First to respond

Title:¬†Deployment to @{triggerOutputs()?['body/OutputParameters/DeploymentStageName']} requires approval

Assigned To:¬†<<YOUR EMAIL HERE>>

Details: Provide the deployment details using the provided markdown format. A sample is provided below:

- 1. **Requested by:** @{triggerOutputs()?['body/OutputParameters/DeployAsUser']}
- 1. **Pipeline:** @{triggerOutputs()?['body/OutputParameters/DeploymentPipelineName']}
- 1. **Target environment:** @{triggerOutputs()?['body/OutputParameters/DeploymentStageName']}
- 1. **Artifact name:** @{triggerOutputs()?['body/OutputParameters/ArtifactName']}
- 1. **Artifact version:** @{triggerOutputs()?['body/OutputParameters/SolutionArtifactVersion']}
- 1. **Scheduled time:** @{triggerOutputs()?['body/OutputParameters/ScheduledTime']}
- 1. **Download Artifact** @{triggerOutputs()?['body/OutputParameters/UnmanagedArtifactFileDownloadLink']}
- 1. **Deployment notes:** @{triggerOutputs()?['body/OutputParameters/AIGeneratedSolutionDescription']}
  - Item Link: @{triggerOutputs()?['body/OutputParameters/StageRunDetailsLink']}
Item Link Description:¬†Stage Link

Click Save


![Screenshot 38](assets/image38.png)

Click + New step and add a condition to check and add ‚Äúresponses approver response‚Äù dynamic variable to the condition. This is the expression parameter: ‚Äúif¬†@items('Apply_to_each')?['approverResponse']¬†is equal to¬†Approve. When you add the Condition parameter, an Apply to each will automatically be added around your condition


![Screenshot 39](assets/image39.png)

In the If yes path, add the Perform an unbound action step from the Microsoft Dataverse connector.

Configure the true condition with the following parameters:

Action Name:¬†UpdateApprovalStatus

ApprovalComments: @{items('Apply_to_each')?['comments']}

StageRunId:¬†@triggerOutputs()?['body/InputParameters/StageRunId']

ApprovalProperties: @{workflow()}

ApprovalStatus:¬†20

Tip: Approval Status Step mappings: Pending- 10, Completed ‚Äì 20, Failed ‚Äì 30


![Screenshot 40](assets/image40.png)

- If the If no path, add the Perform an unbound action step from the Microsoft Dataverse connector.
Configure the false condition with the following parameters:

Action Name:¬†UpdateApprovalStatus

ApprovalComments: @{items('Apply_to_each')?['comments']}

StageRunId:¬†@triggerOutputs()?['body/InputParameters/StageRunId']

ApprovalProperties: @{workflow()}

ApprovalStatus:¬†30

Tip: Approval Status Step mappings: Pending- 10, Completed ‚Äì 20, Failed ‚Äì 30


![Screenshot 41](assets/image41.png)

Save your flow.

We‚Äôre not done yet! Since we will be doing a delegated deployment, we need to make sure to configure the flow to use the SPN credentials to update the UpdateApprovalStatus actions.

- On the If yes Dataverse action, click the 3 dots, check to see if the connection you created earlier is the one associated to this action. It should say ‚ÄúMicrosoft Dataverse.‚Äù If not, click + Add new connection [Connection Reference]

![Screenshot 42](assets/image42.png)

- Configure the connection:
  - Authentication Type: Service Principal
  - Client ID: <Client ID of the App User you created earlier>
  - Client Secret: <Client secret of the App User certificate you created earlier>
  - Tenant: <TenantID you saved earlier>

![Screenshot 43](assets/image43.png)

- Do the same for the If no Dataverse action
- Click Save

### üîß Update Flow after solution import

This section is only needed if you used the solution import method to create your flow. If you created the flow yourself, skip this section and continue on to the ‚ÄúUpdate pipeline to run as delegated‚Äù section.

- After importing your solution, check the following items. If you need help with the steps, refer to the manual flow creation steps above.
  - Ensure the Trigger Condition of your flow has the correct Pipeline name. The sample pipeline is configured for ‚ÄúCustom Host Pipeline‚Äù Update only if you used a different name for your pipeline. Here is a sample trigger condition:
- @equals(triggerOutputs()?['body/OutputParameters/DeploymentPipelineName'], 'Custom Host Pipeline')
  - In the Start and wait action, update the Assigned to field with your username
  - Update the trigger with the SPN connection. Refer to steps 7 and 8
  - Update the If yes and If no connections to use the SPN connection. Refer to step 18 and 19 above, if needed.

### üîß Update pipeline to run as delegated

The flow we just created in the previous section will not trigger until we enable the Is Delegated Deployment gated extension in the pipeline configuration. Now, let‚Äôs configure our pipeline to initiate the flow.

- Return to the Pipeline Host environment, and launch the Deployment Pipeline Configuration app
- Click on the Pipelines tab
- Open the pipeline you created earlier called Custom Host Pipeline
- In the Deployment Stages (Deployment pipeline) grid, open the first stage in your pipeline. This will be the stage with a blank value in the Previous Deployment Stage column.
- On the deployment stage record form, check the box next to Is Delegated Deployment
  - Select Service Principal for Delegated Deployment Type
  - For SPN Client Id, provide the client ID of the app user you created earlier
  - Allow sharing requests: Yes
Take note of the stage Owner field (highlighted in green on the screenshot below). It is important that the owner you added on the Enterprise Application we created earlier match the owner of this stage.


![Screenshot 44](assets/image44.png)

- Click Save & Close

### üîß Create a security role

Let‚Äôs update our Contoso Real Estate solution with an additional component. We will create a security role to include as a part of the solution in our next deployment. We will also use this security role to grant access to users in the target environment after deployment is complete.

- In the developer environment, click on the Solutions tab, then drill into the Contoso Real Estate solution
- Click Objects > +New > then Security > and finally, Security Role

![Screenshot 45](assets/image45.png)

- Configure the Create New Role screen with these details:
  - Role Name: Contoso Real Estate Security Role
  - Business Unit: <root BU, usually begins with ‚Äúorg‚Äù prefix>
  - Member‚Äôs privilege inheritance: Direct User (Basic) access level and Team privileges
  - Check the box for Include App Opener privileges for running Model Driven Apps
  - Click Save

![Screenshot 46](assets/image46.png)

- Search ‚ÄúListing‚Äù on the top right corner to filter Listing tables
- Select Listing table, then click Permission Settings

![Screenshot 47](assets/image47.png)

- Select Collaborate in the Permission Settings blade and click Save

![Screenshot 48](assets/image48.png)

- Repeat steps 4-6 for the Listing Image table as well

### üîß Create a Power Automate Cloud Flow

So far, we do not have any connection references in the app. For the purposes of demonstrating connections and connection sharing capabilities of pipelines, let‚Äôs add a quick flow to our solution. Skip this step if you are running low on time! It is not required to perform a successful delegated deployment.

- In the Contoso Real Estate solution, click + New > then Automation > Cloud Flow > Automated

![Screenshot 49](assets/image49.png)

- Name your flow ‚ÄúSend email for new listings‚Äù
- Search for Dataverse, and select When a row is added, modified, or deleted trigger
- Click Create

![Screenshot 50](assets/image50.png)

- In the maker canvas, on the Trigger action select Oauth Authentication Type and complete the sign in wizard.
- In the Trigger action, complete the following:
  - Change Type: Added
  - Table name: Listings
  - Scope: Organization

![Screenshot 51](assets/image51.png)

- Click +New step
- Search for Outlook and select  Send an email (V2) action
- Configure the Send an email (V2) action like below:
  - To: <your own username>
  - Subject: New Listing
  - Body: We have a new listing: <Name dynamics value>

![Screenshot 52](assets/image52.png)

- Click Save
- In your solution, you will now see 3 new items. In addition to the Cloud Flow, as we used two connections in the flow, one for Dataverse and another for Outlook, we will have 2 connection references added. Connection references are a means to package connection mappings to various actions in a solution.

![Screenshot 53](assets/image53.png)


### üîß Share MDA with Security Role

Now, let‚Äôs bind the Model Driven app with the new Security Role. This will allow us to set up sharing prior to deployment to the target env.

- In the Solution explorer, select the Contoso Real Estate Listings Model Driven App
- Click Share in the ribbon (If the share button is not illuminated, uncheck and click Publish All Customizations first)

![Screenshot 54](assets/image54.png)

- In the Share Contoso Real Estate wizard, select the App
- In the Dataverse connector dropdown, select Contoso Real Estate Security Role

![Screenshot 55](assets/image55.png)

- We are not sharing with any users yet, so go ahead and click Share

### üîß Run SPN delegated pipeline

Finally, let‚Äôs test the new approvals and SPN delegation steps we just added. Go to your development environment, where you just created the security role, and start a deployment using the Custom Host Pipeline. After the usual validation, you will see an additional step called Share which we didn‚Äôt see when deploying before. This step will allow us to share objects within the Target environment directly from your Pipeline deployment. Since we also added a cloud flow with two connections, we will also see a new Connections step when deploying.

After the Select deployment target step, we see the Connections step. Make sure you leave ‚ÄúShare connections with the service principal‚Äù checked as this is a requirement to associate new connections with the connection references in the UAT env.


![Screenshot 56](assets/image56.png)

After clicking Next, we see the Share step:


![Screenshot 57](assets/image57.png)

- Search for Production App Access in the enter a group name box
- Select the Contoso Real Estate Security Role to assign this role to members of the Production App Access team. Click Next
- On the summary tab, take a close look at the AI-generated Deployment Notes section. This will be provided for all approvers to review as a part of the approval request.
- Click Deploy on the next page. The Deployment stage will look like this as the pipeline waits for the approval process to complete:

![Screenshot 58](assets/image58.png)

Now, let‚Äôs approve our deployment. While there are many ways to action on an Approval request in Power Platform, such as Approvals tab on Power Automate Maker portal, Approvals in Teams, or Approval email in Outlook, we will leverage new Advanced Approvals functionality in Deployments to approve the request.  This is a great one-stop-shop like experience for Admins who are responsible for reviewing approvals across multiple pipelines under the same Host or across multiple Hosts.

- Navigate to the PPAC at  https://admin.preview.powerplatform.microsoft.com/deployment/overview
- On the Overview tab, you will see the Pipelines activity section
- Here, you should find the approval you just initiated through your deployment pipeline. Click on it to see the deployment details of the Approval request:

![Screenshot 59](assets/image59.png)

- Provide comments for your request, and click Approve
- Check back on your pipeline after receiving the approval. Your deployment stage will update with ‚ÄúCurrently deploying version #.#.#.#‚Äù

![Screenshot 60](assets/image60.png)

- Once complete, click on the Go to this environment hyperlink on the deployment stage
- Click on the Solutions blade on the left-hand navigation
- Click Managed tab
- Open the Contoso Real Estate solution > On the Model Driven App, select 3 dots > click Share
- On the Share Pane, scroll down and verify that the Production App Access Group is listed

## üéØ Task 4 - Redeploy a prior version

- Prerequisite: If you didn‚Äôt complete task 4, submit another deployment now. Run History should have at least two deployed versions.
While delegated deployments and approvals reduce the chances of breaking applications in production, mistakes can and do happen.

Let‚Äôs pretend the last deployment contained a critical breaking change and it needs to be rolled back. In this task, you‚Äôll re-deploy the last known good version of your solution.

- Open the maker portal (https://make.preview.powerapps.com/) and make sure you are in your development environment
- Open Solutions from the left hand navigation blade
- Open the unmanaged solution (Contoso Real Estate) that you deployed using the pipeline earlier in this lab
- Select Pipelines > click on the Run History tab
- Select the lower version, then Re-deploy from the menu.

- When the deployment panel opens, click Next until you get to the last screen, then Deploy. See prior Task for detailed steps if needed.
- In a new tab, open Power Automate portal again and Approve the deployment request
- Deployment is now in-progress. Wait until it finishes. You may need to refresh the pipelines page.
- Disaster averted! Now the prior version is deployed to production and you have time to fix the (hypothetical) issue and deploy an updated version when ready.
