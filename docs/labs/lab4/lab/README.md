## Optional: Supercharge your Power Pages development with Power Platform Tools VS Code Extension and PAC MCP Server

Power Platform Tools is a Visual Studio Code extension that streamlines the development and management of Power Pages sites. It offers features such as:

- Copilot for Power Pages
- Liquid intellisense support
- Seamless creation of new content like web pages, web templates etc. using right-click context menus.
- Power Pages Actions: A single place to manage all your Power Pages sites including site upload/download and site preview.

### Install Power Platform Tools Extension

1. Open VS Code Desktop.
1. Click on the Extensions icon from the left menu.
1. Search for **Power Platform Tools** and click on **Install**.

    ![Install Power Platform Tools Extension](images/install-power-platform-tools.png)

1. After installation, the extension will ask you to login. Use the same credentials you are using for Power Pages Maker Studio.

1. You can also install it from this [VS Code Marketplace](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=microsoft-IsvExpTools.powerplatform-vscode).

### Install PAC MCP Server

1. Ensure you have latest .NET installed.
1. Download PAC CLI by running below command in terminal:

    ```powershell
    dotnet tool install --global Microsoft.PowerApps.CLI.Tool
    ```

1. Run below command to get the MCP Server location:

    ```powershell
    pac copilot mcp
    ```

1. This will print out the MCP Server location. Copy the URL and add in your VS Code. It should look something like below:

    ```json
    "pac-mcp": {
        "type": "stdio",
        "command": "<MCP Server Location>",
        "args": []
    }
    ```

1. You can now use GitHub Copilot to manage your Power Pages sites using natural language.
