# ðŸ§ª Lab 4: Lifecycle Mastery in Power Pages

In this lab, you'll get hands-on experience with managing the lifecycle of Power Pages within Managed Environments. You'll learn how to leverage source code management, environment routing, and deployment pipelines to ensure your Power Pages applications are secure, compliant, and efficiently managed throughout their lifecycle.

## Agenda

1. Intro and overview of Power Pages and their dev tools support
1. Scenario 1: Power pages site (EDM) with source code
    1. Use environmental variables in site (VS Code Web)
    1. Packages site in solution (show solution explorer improvements)
    1. Use power pipeline to move site (highlight that users can use all previously demonstrated capabilities with power pages, AI Notes)
1. Scenario 2: BYOC for Pages with source code (+git enable)
    1. Use VSCode desktop and its Power Pages Action pane capabilities for demo with local development setup
    1. Create a new feature and merge to the git main branch
    1. Use git CI/CD to push this to prod (also highlight that, users can use previously setup power pipeline and all its capabilities for same purpose)
1. New capabilities | date in NAM:
    1. Solution explorer improvement
